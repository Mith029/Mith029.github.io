## 1.	Airplane Safety Performance (Delta Airlines)
Evaluating Delta Air Lines’s safety performance and comparing with motor depict the reliability of Delta’s air carriers using data visualization and relevant statistics.

## 2.	Attributes Associated with Cardiovascular Disease
Analyzing several health factors that affect a patient’s risk for heart disease.

## 3.	Blackjack
This project is a basic text-based implementation of the popular card game, where the user plays against a computer dealer.

## 4.	Botnet Detection
A deep learning model capable of detecting and prevent botnets by analyzing time-series data of network traffic and other relevant features.

## 5.	Consumer Prediction
Formulating python algorithms from a given dataset using machine learning technique to predict the actions of consumers. 

## 6.	Cryptocurrency
A socket-to-client connection block-chain application that allows users to utilize the service as cryptocurrency and be used to mine and store within a crypto-wallet. 

## 7.	Drowsiness Alert system
A drowsiness alert system designed to send push notifications to users’ emails and phones by detecting a driver getting drowsy while operating a motor vehicle by analyzing their eye movement.

## 8.	The Impact of Air pollution
Analyzing the impact of Air pollution, primarily focusing on carbon emission and fatality rates, worldwide to dispel the myth revolving around climate change.
